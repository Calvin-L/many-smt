# 2021/5/17: the standard is a little ambiguous about whether solvers should
# output "success" after a (reset) command.  Many-SMT DOES output "success",
# with the following justification:
#  - (reset) is a command like any other
#  - (reset) restores the initial value of :print-success, which is true
#  - section 4.2.1 of the SMT-LIB 2.6 standard says that "In particular, for
#    options that affect the solverâ€™s output [...] the effect applies already
#    to the output of the very command that is setting the option."
